# Shilp
##Introduction

India, a country with varied culture has always been known for its ethnic craftsmanship. It includes craft arts like pottery, basket making, embroidery etc. The importance of this sector has largely echoed from the times of independence itself and is considered an important aspect of rural development. However, this important sector has suffered large problems which can be solved by this Android Application.

## Functionalities

Shilp (an Android Application) provides a platform for the rural craftsmen to showcase their artwork as well as let buyers and recruiters to identify and recruit such craftsmen.The application shall include these basic functionalities
1)	Crafts/Product for Sale: Showcasing crafts/products shall include details like -image, name and category of product, price, location of the craftsman, rating of the product based on previous sales, timings of the shop(in case of individual pick up).
2)	Skill Exposure of Rural Craftsmen: (an online resume, approaching related market recruiters ):  An individual can upload their profile online if he/she wishes a recruitment/similar offer. This can serve as an online resume for the craftsmen of rural area exposing them to market recruiters having similar needs. Details of the resume may include: category of crafts, wage range expected, area or distance from home up-to which he/she wishes to travel for work etc. Apart from this they may also approach the recruiters to apply for an offer in any advertised demand by the recruiter. Quality of service provided can be ascertained through a Rating Mechanism based on previous sales.
3)	Interface for recruiters to identify skilled workmen / advertise a specific demand for workmen (include filtering techniques based on area/distance, range of wage , category of crafts ): Recruiters who aim to harness and manage a large group of skilled workmen can view the currently available workforce in the market. The interface shall include filtering techniques like area, range of wage, category of crafts. The recruiters can also put up a specific demand in the market for a particular product which can be approached by these workmen.
4)	Logistics System for pickup and delivery of crafts (optional , individual pickup can also be allowed): In the long run we also propose a logistics system to smoothen the process of sale and delivery.
5)	Help through App Volunteers: Considering one of the mentioned problems - “A major section of the craft sector is not literate enough to use online marketing for their products”, we can have App Volunteers in a rural area who can identify and upload profiles of such candidates. They can also serve as training head for these sections.
